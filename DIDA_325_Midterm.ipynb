The goal of this project is to analyze data from 11 different states along with Washington D.C., and identify any trends in voter registration in these parts of the United States. This notebook gives insights on how and if voting regsitration has changed from the 2016 to 2020 elections across different months and if there are any patterns nationally or state wide. This information provided by this notebook helps us understand voter regsitration patterns and shifts in voter turnout. In addition, this analysis may be helpful to assess policy impacts and improve voter engagement.\n",

        "**Insights:**\n",
        "This notebook analyzed the differences in new voter registration over select months in 2016 and 2020 for a small sample of the United States. In general, new voter registration numbers are higher in earlier months (January-March), specifically in 2020. This is illustrated in the graph: Average Registered Voters for States in the US. Additionally, when looking at the line graph: Comparison of Arizona & Georgia New Voter Registrations in 2020, we can see a rise of new registered voters in January and February, where as the numbers dropped off after Febuary. This trend could be due to the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. In addition, more populated states such as Texas and California, have higher numbers of new registered voters and lower populated states have lower numbers, such that in February, 2020 **California** had the highest amount of new voters of **238,281**. This is also seen in the bar graph: Total New Registered Voters per State for 2016 and 2020 and the map: Average Registered Voters (2016 and 2020 data)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Suggestions:**\n",
        "Given that new voter registration declined after March in both 2016 and 2020, I would suggest examining awareness campaigns that were used before this period and also focus on demographics with observed lower registration rates. It is important to recognize the pandemics influence on the  steeper drop in registered voters in 2020 as a result of closings, lockdowns, and social distancing. Accordingly, it is important to ensure the ability to register to vote remains accessible to anyone that is eligible, as well as exploring areas where it is not as accessible to ensure voter participation even beyond the pandemic to strengthen democracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps:**\n",
        "Gathering more data to include in this analysis of new voter registration in the United States will be helpful in answering our research questions more completely. For instance, including data for the rest of the states within the United States will help understand voter regsitration of the United States more thoroughly, as well as collecting data for the full year would help make better conclusions. It would be interesting to explore voter registraion between Republican and Democratic states to see the influence political affiliation may have on certain election years to undertstand factors driving voter registration numbers. Specifically, to explore our second research question more, collecting demographic information of the voters to see if states like Arizona and Georgia for example, who were historically more Republican and switched after the 2020 election, differ in new voter registration. Also including data from past presidential elections prior to 2016 and including 2024 election data can better explore changes in voter registration over time and compare to 2020 to evaluate potential differences caused by COVID-19. Lastly, to address one of the limitations, future research should include voter registration in terms of proportions to the states popualtion size to compare across states more accurately."
